title: Monte Carlo Tree Search

Hi!

This blog is briefly discusses about Monte Carlo Tree Search shortly called as MCTS, a heuristic search algorithm.

As it's name suggests, MCTS is an algorithm which is used for finding the best sequence of nodes in a tree for maximizing the outcome of an experiment/trial. This outcome is commonly called as "reward". 

The most common example where MCTS is used is in the Tic-Tac-Toe game. In a 2-playered Tic-Tac-Toe game, with one intelligent player, we expect to develop a player controlled by AI which is capable enough to beat the intelligent player.
