Hi!

This blog is briefly discusses about Monte Carlo Tree Search shortly called as MCTS, a heuristic search algorithm.

As it's name suggests, MCTS is an algorithm which is used for finding the best sequence of nodes in a tree for maximizing the outcome of an experiment/trial. This outcome is commonly called as "reward". The most common example is the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
